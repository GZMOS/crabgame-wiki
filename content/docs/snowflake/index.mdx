description: A C# library and framework for creating Crab Game dedicated servers
---

Welcome to the Snowflake documentation. <br />
Snowflake is a C# library for creating and running Crab Game dedicated servers, written from scratch by <Contributor id="lualt" />.

### Features

* Snowflake servers are cheaper and easier to run than running the actual game.
* Clients can connect to one main lobby and switch seamlessly between its dendrites (virtual servers functioning similarly to proxies).
* You're given lots of control over how packets are sent and handled.
