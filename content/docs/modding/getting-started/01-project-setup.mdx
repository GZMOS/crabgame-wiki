description: Set up your development environment for Crab Game modding with BepInEx and Il2Cpp
---

## Overview

To start making your mod, you're going to need a Visual Studio project that's properly configured for making a BepInEx Il2Cpp mod.

Doing this manually can take a lot of effort, so <Contributor id="lammas123" /> has provided a template project.


<Callout type="info">
The template takes a tiny bit of manual effort to get ready, but it's much better than starting from scratch!
</Callout>

## Using the Template

Head over to the [CrabTemplate repository](https://github.com/lammas321/CrabTemplate) and follow the setup instructions.

The template includes:
- Pre-configured BepInEx Il2Cpp setup
- Proper project structures
- Essential references and dependencies

## Next Steps

Once your project is set up, you need to understand how to actually read the game's code, which is obfuscated. Continue to the next section to learn how to analyze the game.
