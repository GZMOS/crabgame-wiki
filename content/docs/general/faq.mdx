## General

### Why am I crashing or seeing floating players?

**Crashing**: If you're experiencing frequent crashes, install [Anti Crasher](https://thunderstore.io/c/crab-game/p/lammas123/AntiCrasher/) by <Contributor id="lammas123" />. P2P sessions and packets from those who aren't in your current lobby are discarded, along with packets which would result in invalid game state (NaN, Infinite, or impossible values) and packets that are normally unused by the game, avoiding any crashers targeting you.

**Floating players**: This is caused by a Steam P2P update (around March 2024) that made it more difficult to establish P2P connections, especially in larger lobbies (12+ players). Install [CrabGameFloatingPlayerPatch](https://thunderstore.io/c/crab-game/p/lammas123/FloatingPlayerPatch/) by <Contributor id="lammas123" />. If you're hosting, the mod takes positions and rotations clients send to you and forwards them back out to all clients. If you're a client, the mod sends your position to the host more frequently to help work around the issue.

<Callout type="warn">
This does not fix the root issue, only works around it. Very large lobbies (30+) may still struggle to connect, and as the host you should aim to be near the majority of players.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
Both mods are **recommended** for anyone playing in public lobbies, especially in larger ones.

### Does modding get me banned?

There is no official anti-cheat in Crab Game, and there have been no known bans for modding. Using mods that give you an unfair advantage in public lobbies is frowned upon by the community.

<Callout type="warn">Modding is always at your own risk.</Callout>

### Why are there no servers in the server list after installing BepInEx?

The game detects BepInEx and hides servers from the list as a result. Some mods bypass this detection, such as [CrabGame.AntiAntiBepinex](https://github.com/o7Moon/CrabGame.AntiAntiBepinex) by <Contributor id="o7moon" />.

### Where do I see BepInEx logs?

Logs are written to `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` in your game folder. You can also enable the BepInEx console window in `BepInEx/config/BepInEx.cfg` by setting `Enabled = true` under `[Logging.Console]`.

If you want a more powerful in-game log viewer, [AntroBetterConsole](https://thunderstore.io/c/crab-game/p/Crab_Hub/AntroBetterConsole/) by <Contributor id="antropomeda" /> is a good option. It lets you filter, search, and copy logs without leaving the game.

<Callout type="info">This mod is optional. The standard log file and BepInEx console work fine for most users.</Callout>

### Where do I start with modding?

Head over to the [Modding](/docs/modding/getting-started/01-project-setup) section to get started.

## Installation & Usage

### Where can I find mods to download?

Most Crab Game mods can be found on community hubs like [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/crab-game/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/). You can also find active modding discussions and support in the some Crab Game modding Discord servers.

### Do I have to install mods manually?

No, you don't have to! While you can manually drag and drop files into your `BepInEx/plugins` folder, many players prefer using a mod manager like r2modman or the Thunderstore Mod Manager. These tools handle BepInEx installation, mod updates, and dependencies automatically.

### How do I completely remove mods and BepInEx?

If you used a mod manager, use it to uninstall everything from there. If you installed manually, go to your Crab Game directory and delete the `BepInEx` folder, the `doorstop_config.ini` file, and the `winhttp.dll` file. If you need help, check the [Discord servers](/docs/general/discord).

### Can I mod Crab Game on a Steam Deck or Linux?

Yes, but it requires an extra step. Because Crab Game runs through Proton on Linux/SteamOS, BepInEx won't hook into the game automatically. You need to open the game's Properties in Steam, go to the General tab, and paste this into your Launch Options:

```
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%
```

## Multiplayer Compatibility

### Do my friends need to install the same mods for us to play together?

It depends on the mod:

- **Client-side mods** - These only affect your game (e.g. UI tweaks, custom crosshairs, client-side visuals). Your friends do not need these installed to play with you.
- **Server-side mods** - Most of the time server-side mods only need to be installed by the host. However if you are using custom maps or mods that add new content, everyone in the lobby may need the same mods installed to avoid desyncs or crashes.

<Callout type="warn">Always check the mod's description to know what's required!</Callout>
